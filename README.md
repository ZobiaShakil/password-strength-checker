# password-strength-checker

I wrote a Python script that checks password strength using regex, ensuring that a password meets criteria like minimum length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. I then transformed this script into a web application using Flask, integrating it with HTML and CSS for a user-friendly interface that provides real-time feedback on password strength.
